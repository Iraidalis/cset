1.	Why do you think it's important that HTML is an open standard controlled by a specification rather than being owned by one person or company? I think is very important that html is an open standard controlled specification rather than owned by a person because anyone has the same opportunities to create their own websites without having to pay someone or a company to then create it. 

2. 	Describe the difference between an element and a tag. Use examples. The tags are used to hold the element. The tags start with < and end with>. The element holds the content and is it written inside the tags.

3. In the lecture, I used two quotes from Yoda and Noam Chomsky to explain syntax and semantics. Explain these quotes and how they relate to the HTML you write. The firs quote was “The greatest teacher, failure is.” -YODA this quote does not follow the rules of syntax but makes perfectly sense and you can understand it. Semantics is that no matter if is well written or if it follows the rule of syntax it has a meaning and you can understand it. It relates to HTML because introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. The second quote was “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.”-Noam Chomsky. This quote did follow the rules of syntax but did not make sense. This also relates to HTML because you can have the correct syntax in HTML but may not have any meaning.
