•	After completing the first course, how would you rate yourself? Is there anything you want to do differently to start the next course? I would rate myself five out of ten. Honestly, I should have asked more questions about things that I couldn’t understand. for this next course I’ll ask question and I will participate more in the group discussions. 
•	The Weresquirrel program showed many uses for JavaScript Objects and Arrays. Using variables and values from this example, explain the difference between the two data structures. The mainly difference between an object and arrays is that an object is mainly used to store properties and an array is used to store an order of number or a list of events.
•	Now explain why the author chose to use one structure over the other for each example you chose. Follow the same reasoning and explain how you could have used objects and arrays in your adventure game from last week. In the author used the arrays structure to describe the order of events. For example, here:
//The words inside the brackets are events
```addEntry (["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running",
          "television"], false);
addEntry (["work", "ice cream", "cauliflower", "lasagna",
          "touched tree", "brushed teeth"], false);
addEntry (["weekend", "cycling", "break", "peanuts",
          "beer"], true); ```
In the game I could have used made an object to describe a person and add properties like first name, last name, etc. For example:
```Let killer= {
Firstname: “Ira”
Lastname:”Lugo”
};```
