1.	How do you feel about the pace of the program so far? Is it too slow? Too fast? Or, just right? I feel we are going too fast because I didn’t have any experience before. I sometimes feel really overwhelmed. I have been practicing a lot every day and I feel more comfortable with everything . 

2.	Why do you think functions are a useful tool to organize large programs? Functions are very useful because for example, we are now working in a project and we are creating a mini game. The function helps us organize a whole scene in the game.

3.	In class, we've been using the analogy of a zoo to explain scope. Describe the different types of scope using this analogy and provide examples using real JavaScript code. The different types of scopes are the local and global. An example of a global scope is, when you declare a variable outside of a function or brackets this means that you can use the variable everywhere in the code, even in the function. 

//the variable below con be used everywhere in the code
```let grade= prompt ("Enter Grade"); 
if (grade >= 90) {
  	console.log("A");
}; ```
	An example of a local scopes is that if you declared a variable inside a function you won’t be able to use it outside the function.

//the variable hello can’t be used outside of the brackets

```{	Const hello= “hi”
		Console.log(hello)}```
