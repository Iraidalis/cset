This is your last assessment of the semester. Overall, how comfortable would you feel answering questions like these in job interviews? Have they helped more than regular tests or quizzes? The assessments have really helped me. is a really good way to think about the vocabulary and new words. In the Web development course comparing the difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout helped me understand it better.
In the readings this week, you learned a sampling of client-side tooling. Choose one tool that you think will be the most beneficial for you. Explain what it does and why that's important. One of the tools I think will be very beneficial for me is the code formatter Prettier. This formatter makes sure the code is format correctly according to our own rules.
Compare the different stages of the Waterfall and Agile methodologies using the Tic-Tac-Toe game as an example. In our project we worked on different stages at the time. Using the waterfall methodology each stage generally finishes before the next one can begin. I think that because we both worked on the requirements and the harder function first, we were able to finish the requirements on Wednesday and then work on the style and the extras.
