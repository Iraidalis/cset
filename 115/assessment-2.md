 What do you think will be the most difficult aspect of developing a project in a larger team? I think some of the most difficult aspects of developing a project in a larger team are the merge conflicts, even though git can resolve some differences between branches and merge the automatically sometimes there are changes that can be automatically solve and you must resolve all merge conflicts before you can merge. this is  why i think is going to be very difficult developing a project in groups.


Briefly describe a branch and a remote. Compare the defaults to examples that you created. a branch represents a series of commits, for example you can create a branch and make changes in it and commit and then you can merge the branch to the master branch. a remote the repository where all the groups exchange there commits and changes.  


For the collaborative project this week, which git workflow(s) did you employ? Why? for this project i used the feature branch because I created a branch and then merged the commits to their main branch.
